          “For me, the ‘Lover’ album is open fields and sunsets and SUMMER,”
          Swift wrote in the social-media post announcing the tour. “I want to
          celebrate the album and perform it live with you in a way that feels
          authentic to the music. I want to go to some places I haven’t been,
          and play festivals for the first time in ages…and where we didn’t have
          festivals, we made some.”
