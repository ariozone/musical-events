          “For me, the ‘Lover’ album is open fields and sunsets and SUMMER,”
          Swift wrote in the social-media post announcing the tour. “I want to
          celebrate the album and perform it live with you in a way that feels
          authentic to the music. I want to go to some places I haven’t been,
          and play festivals for the first time in ages…and where we didn’t have
          festivals, we made some.”
          {/* After the tragic bombing at Ariana Grande‘s Manchester concert on May
          22, the pop superstar called upon the biggest names in music to come
          together to help raise money for those impacted. Today, the One Love
          Manchester benefit concert was held inside Manchester United’s home
          stadium Old Trafford, and thousands gathered to watch some of their
          favorite artists come together for a good cause. Streamed live on
          Twitter, the concert was a moving display of musical talent that
          started off with Marcus Mumford‘s performance of “Timshel.” */}
